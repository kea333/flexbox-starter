                Hi, I'm CodeSensei337. Here are some quotes I'm sure you'll enjoy.
                <br>Some are fairly serious, others require a sense of humour.
                <br>All are however great! Enjoy :) .

                I have a dream today! I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, 
                the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, 
                and all flesh shall see it together.

                It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt.<br>
                <br>
                Don't let schooling interfere with your education.<br>

                It's no wonder that truth is stranger than fiction. Fiction has to make sense.<br>

                All generalizations are false, including this one.<br>

                Courage is the most important of all the virtues, because without courage you can't practice any other virtue consistently. 
                You can practice any virtue erratically, but nothing consistently without courage.<br>

                My mother said I must always be intolerant of ignorance but understanding of illiteracy. That some people, unable to go to school, 
                were more educated and more intelligent than college professors.

                The fundamental laws necessary for the mathematical treatment of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus 
                completely known, and the difficulty lies only in the fact that application of these laws leads to equations that are too 
                complex to be solved.<br>
